.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBflickrdf\fP is a utility that uses the \fIphotos.getInfo\fP API to
interpret the description fields and the tags for a photo URI into RDF
triples. If raptor is present, it will be used to provide proper
serializing to RDF rather than the built in and hacky ntriples/turtle
output.
.PP
Machine tags when they are found are scanned for \fIxmlns:prefix=uri\fP and
then all other machine tags with that prefix turn into
triples. Several prefixes are also pre-defined by the library to
automatically get turned into triples without an xmlns, such as \fIblue:\fP,
\fIcell:\fP, \fIfilter:\fP and \fIgeo:\fP. Non-machine tags are not yet interpreted.
